# Funes

This project is an engine for the game Ataxx. I'm using it as a playground to test ideas and, 
while I'm at it, make a decent Ataxx engine.

All comments and feedback are appreciated. Feel free to join us at `##chessprogramming` on [Freenode IRC](https://webchat.freenode.net) and share your thoughts.

## Running the code

You can get the code running by following three simple steps:

1. Download the code
```
git clone https://github.com/Tempate/Funes
```

2. Type the command:
```
make release
```

3. An executable should now appear inside your bin folder, you can run it by doing: 
```
./Funes
```
